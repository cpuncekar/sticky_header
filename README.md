# Sticky Header Example

This repository contains a simple example of creating a sticky header for a website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Getting Started

To view the sticky header example, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How it Works

The sticky header is achieved by using Bootstrap's `sticky-top` class on the navbar element. Custom CSS is added to ensure the header stays fixed at the top of the viewport while scrolling. JavaScript libraries (jQuery, Popper.js, and Bootstrap JS) are included for Bootstrap functionalities like responsive navbar toggling.
